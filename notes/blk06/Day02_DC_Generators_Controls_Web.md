# Day 2 — Direct‑Current Generators and Their Controls

## What a DC Generator Does

A **direct‑current (DC) generator** converts engine rotation into DC power for the aircraft electrical system. It supplies the buses and recharges the battery once the engine is running.

## Inside the Generator — Materials and Parts

- **Field frame and pole pieces**: laminated **steel** that creates the magnetic field.
- **Armature**: **copper windings** on an iron core that spin within the field.
- **Commutator**: **copper segments** separated by **mica** insulation; this is where the current leaves the armature.
- **Brushes**: **carbon/graphite** blocks that ride on the commutator to carry current out of the machine.
- **Bearings and housing**: **steel** shafts with **grease‑lubricated** bearings and an **aluminum** or **steel** case.

## Control Boxes and Relays

- **Voltage Regulator (VR) or Generator Control Unit (GCU)** keeps output steady.
- **Reverse‑current relay** prevents the battery from back‑feeding a weak generator.
- **Current limiter** protects the generator from being overloaded.
- **Paralleling circuits** share load between two generators so one does not do all the work.

## Starter‑Generators (Common on Turbine Aircraft)

A **starter‑generator** starts the engine first, then switches to generator mode. It has heavy **copper windings**, a robust **armature**, and strong **cooling** requirements. Respect the time limits and temperature limits to avoid insulation damage.

## What Usually Fails and How It Looks

- **Worn brushes or dirty commutator** → fluctuating voltage or poor output.
- **Loose terminals or mounts** → heat marks, arcing, or a burning smell.
- **Mis‑wiring or wrong rotation** → reversed polarity or no output.

## Key Takeaways

- Keep the generator **clean, cool, and tight**.
- Verify the **control unit** functions (regulation, protection, and sharing).
