# Day01 Electrical Basics

## Big Ideas

- **Voltage** is the “pressure” that pushes electricity through a circuit.
- **Current** is the flow of electricity.
- **Resistance** is how hard it is for the flow to move through a material.
- **Power** is how much work or heat the system is producing.

## Direct Current and Alternating Current

- **Direct Current (DC)** flows in one direction. Batteries and many small‑aircraft systems use DC.
- **Alternating Current (AC)** changes direction many times per second. Large transport airplanes often use AC because it is efficient for generating and distributing power.

## What Things Are Made Of

- **Wires** are usually **copper** (good conductor). Some systems use **aluminum** for weight savings, but copper is more common in aircraft wiring harnesses.
- **Insulation** around wires can be **ETFE** (marketed as Tefzel), **PTFE** (polytetrafluoroethylene, often called Teflon), or **polyimide** (Kapton blends) for high temperature areas.
- **Terminals and contacts** are **copper alloys** that are plated with **tin, silver, nickel, or gold** to resist corrosion and reduce contact resistance.
- **Circuit boards and electronic parts**: silicon‑based semiconductors, epoxy‑glass boards, and aluminum heat sinks.
- **Batteries** use metal plates and liquid electrolytes (see Day 1 “Batteries” below).

## Batteries You Will See

Quick reference from the slides:

- Lead-Acid Batteries Lead-Acid are the most commonly used storage battery Typically, constructed with 6 or 12 cells Each cell produces approximately 2.1 volts
- The cells are rechargeable and deliver a voltage of 1.2 volts during discharge
- Aircraft Batteries Capacity is measured quantitatively inches ampere-hours delivered at a specified discharge rate to a specified cut-off voltage at room temperature.
  - Battery ratings specifications – the one-hour rate is the rate of discharge a battery can endure for 1 hour with the battery voltage at or above 1.67 volts per cell or 20 volts for a 24-volt lead-acid battery or 10 volts for a 12-volt lead-acid battery.
  - Storing and Servicing – To prevent freezing damage, maintainches each cell’s specific gravity at 1.275 or, for sealed lead-acid batteries, check open circuit voltage.
- manufactured lead-acid batteries are considered fully charged when the specific gravity reading is between 1.275 and 1.300 amps 1/3 discharged battery reads about 1.240 and a 2/3 discharged battery shows a specific gravity reading of about 1.200 when tested by a hydrometer at an electrolyte temperature of 80 degrees F.
- Aircraft Batteries Battery charging For lead-acid batteries, the voltage per cell must not exceed 2.35 volts.
- Constant Current Charging: Most convenient for charging batteries outside of the airplane because several batteries of varying voltages may be charged at once on the same system.

- **Lead‑acid battery**: Plates of **lead** and **lead dioxide** in a **sulfuric acid** and water solution. Common on small aircraft. Keep the case clean and dry; ensure vents or recombination caps work properly.
- **Nickel‑cadmium (Ni‑Cd) battery**: **Nickel** and **cadmium** plates with a **potassium hydroxide** solution as the electrolyte. Delivers strong current but can overheat if charged incorrectly. Monitor temperature and follow the charging procedure exactly to avoid **thermal runaway**.

## Safe Habits That Prevent Problems

- De‑energize a circuit before you touch it and verify with a meter where practical.
- Cover exposed terminals; keep tools and jewelry away from energized buses.
- Treat large capacitors (for example, in strobe light power supplies) as if they are still charged for several minutes after power‑off.
- Clean, tight connections prevent heat. Heat is the enemy of insulation and connectors.

## Key Takeaways

- Use the **right wire and insulation** for the location.
- Keep runs **short, supported, and protected**.
- Poor connections cause **heat, arcing, and intermittent faults**.\n
