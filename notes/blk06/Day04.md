# Day04 Wires Routing

## Choosing Wire and Insulation

- **Copper conductors** are standard; occasionally **aluminum** is used for large power runs to save weight (follow the specific installation data).
- **Insulation choices** depend on location:
  - **ETFE (Tefzel)**: common, tough, and lightweight.
  - **PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene)**: very high temperature and chemical resistance.
  - **Polyimide (Kapton blends)**: excellent heat resistance; handle carefully to avoid cuts.

## Marking and Identifying

Quick reference from the slides:

- Indirectly-marked wire or cable should be identified at each end and at intervals not longer than 6 feet.
- transmit signals that indicate the position of the aircraft along the glidepath to the runway Outer marker beacon transmitter located 4 – 7 miles from the threshold Transmits a 75 megahertz (MHz) carrier wave modulated with a 400 hertz (Hz) audio tone inches a series of dashes amps marker beacon receiver receives the signal and uses it to light a blue light on the instrument panel Middle marker beacon also used – located approximately 3,500 feet from the runway, transmits on 75 megahertz (MHz);.
- when signal received, it is used inches the receiver to illuminate an amber-colored light on the instrument panel Some ILS approaches have an inner marker beacon that transmits a signal modulated with 3,000 hertz (Hz).

- Mark **both ends** of each wire and at intervals so maintenance can trace it later.
- Keep identification visible near **connectors**.

## Routing Rules of Thumb

Quick reference from the slides:

- The individual wires inside a cable should be identified withinches 3 inches of their termination.
- To prevent damage to wires caused by solvents or other corrosive fluids, plastic tubing should be used to protect the wire, if the wire has a low point between the tubing ends provide 1/8 inch drainches hole.
- Bonding: Bonding is the electrical connecting of two or more conducting objects not otherwise adequately connected The following bonding requirements must be considered:
  - Equipment bonding – low-impedance paths to aircraft structure are normally required for electronic equipment to provide radio frequency return circuits and for most electrical equipment to facilitate reduction inches.
  - EMI Metallic surface bonding – all conducting objects on the exterior of the airframe must be electrically connected to the airframe through mechanical joints, conductive hinges, or bond straps capable of conducting static charges and lightning strikes.
  - Static bonds – all isolated conducting parts inside and outside the aircraft, having an area greater than 3 square inches and a linear dimension over 3 inches, that are subjected to appreciable electrostatic charging due to precipitation, fluid, or air inches motion, should have a mechanically secure electrical connection to the aircraft structure of sufficient conductivity to dissipate possible static charges.
- Single cord-lacing used for 1 inch diameter or less Double cord on 1 inch or larger Lacing & Tying Wire Bundles.
- Lacing & Tying Wire Bundles Use wire group or bundle ties where the supports for the wire are more than 12 inches apart.
- The size of the studs on a terminal strip usually range from size 6 up to about 1 inch inches diameter, with the smaller sizes suitable only for low current control circuits.
- VOR uses VHF radio waves (108 – 117.95 megahertz (MHz)) with 50 kilohertz (kHz) separation between each channel To receive VOR VHF radio waves, generally a volts-shaped, horizontally polarized, bi-pole antenna is used amps VOR transmitter produces two signals that a receiver on board an aircraft uses to locate itself inches relation to the ground station;.

- Avoid **sharp edges**, **hot lines**, and **moving parts**.
- Use **grommets** where bundles pass through structure and **clamps** to support runs so they do not sag or rub.
- Leave a **gentle bend radius**—no kinks. Keep a **small service loop** near connectors.

## Controlling Interference

- Separate **noisy power lines** (motors, strobes) from **sensitive avionics** runs.
- Use **shielded cable** and **proper grounding** where the installation requires it.

## Checklist

- Correct **gauge** and **insulation** for the environment.
- **Label**, **support**, and **protect** every run.\n
