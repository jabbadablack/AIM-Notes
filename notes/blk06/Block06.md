## Genrators and Alternators

- **starter generator:** when you employ a generator and a starter combined into one unit.
- **AC Alternators:** Found on aircraft that use a large amount of electrical power.
- **CSD:** Constant-Speed Drive  
  *to ensure the alternator rotates at the correct speed to ensure a 400-Hz frequency.*
- CSD is monitored by a *tachometer generator.*

**Two most common units:**

- Bus Power Control Unit (BPCU)
- GCU (Generator Control Unit)

AC alternator control systems on large transport category aircraft have redundant systems.

An inverter is used to provide AC when needed for light aircraft. *(Changes DC to AC)*

## Wiring Diagrams

- Two most generally used conductors are: *Copper and Aluminum*
- The material used to insulate commutator bars is *Mica.*
- The rotation of a generator is termed either clockwise or counter-clockwise when viewed from *the drive end.*
- To prevent fluids or condensation from running down the wire we ensure the wire has a *Splice.*
- The slack in a wire bundle between supports must not be greater than **1/2"** with maximum hand pressure.
- The proper conduit size for a specific wire bundle or cable require that the conduit inner diameter should be ~**25%** larger than the anticipated maximum diameter of the wires.
- *Shielding* is the process of applying a metalic covering to wiring and equipment to eliminate electromagnetic interference (EMI).
- Two fundamental properties of the wire insulation are: **Insulation resistance** and **dielectric strength.**
- The AMM must be followed to replace a wire.
- Wire is manufactured in sizes according to a standard known as the *American Wire Gauge (AWG)*
- Aircraft electrical system wiring and cable may be marked with a combination of *letters, numbers and colors.*
- Identification and markings should be placed at each end of the wire and at **3" from each end and every 15"** along the wire maximum intervals along the length of the wire.

**Recommended procedures for installing aircraft wiring:**

- *Open Wiring:* Open wiring is any wire, wire group or wire bundle not enclose in a conduit.
- *Wire Group:* A Wire group is two or more wires going to the same location and physically ties together to retain their group identity.
