# Day 1 — Electrical Basics

## Big Ideas

- **Voltage** is the “pressure” that pushes electricity through a circuit.
- **Current** is the flow of electricity.
- **Resistance** is how hard it is for the flow to move through a material.
- **Power** is how much work or heat the system is producing.

> Tip: In the shop you will mostly reason about symptoms (dim lights, hot connectors, slow motors) rather than numbers.

## Direct Current and Alternating Current

- **Direct Current (DC)** flows in one direction. Batteries and many small‑aircraft systems use DC.
- **Alternating Current (AC)** changes direction many times per second. Large transport airplanes often use AC because it is efficient for generating and distributing power.

## What Things Are Made Of

- **Wires** are usually **copper** (good conductor). Some systems use **aluminum** for weight savings, but copper is more common in aircraft wiring harnesses.
- **Insulation** around wires can be **ETFE** (marketed as Tefzel), **PTFE** (polytetrafluoroethylene, often called Teflon), or **polyimide** (Kapton® blends) for high temperature areas.
- **Terminals and contacts** are **copper alloys** that are plated with **tin, silver, nickel, or gold** to resist corrosion and reduce contact resistance.
- **Circuit boards and electronic parts**: silicon‑based semiconductors, epoxy‑glass boards, and aluminum heat sinks.
- **Batteries** use metal plates and liquid electrolytes (see Day 1 “Batteries” below).

## Batteries You Will See

- **Lead‑acid battery**: Plates of **lead** and **lead dioxide** in a **sulfuric acid** and water solution. Common on small aircraft. Keep the case clean and dry; ensure vents or recombination caps work properly.
- **Nickel‑cadmium (Ni‑Cd) battery**: **Nickel** and **cadmium** plates with a **potassium hydroxide** solution as the electrolyte. Delivers strong current but can overheat if charged incorrectly. Monitor temperature and follow the charging procedure exactly to avoid **thermal runaway**.

## Safe Habits That Prevent Problems

- De‑energize a circuit before you touch it and verify with a meter where practical.
- Cover exposed terminals; keep tools and jewelry away from energized buses.
- Treat large capacitors (for example, in strobe light power supplies) as if they are still charged for several minutes after power‑off.
- Clean, tight connections prevent heat. Heat is the enemy of insulation and connectors.

## Key Takeaways

- Use the **right wire and insulation** for the location.
- Keep runs **short, supported, and protected**.
- Poor connections cause **heat, arcing, and intermittent faults**.
