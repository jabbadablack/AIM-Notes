# Day  4 — Wires, Insulation, and Routing

## Choosing Wire and Insulation

- **Copper conductors** are standard; occasionally **aluminum** is used for large power runs to save weight (follow the specific installation data).
- **Insulation choices** depend on location:
  - **ETFE (Tefzel)**: common, tough, and lightweight.
  - **PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene)**: very high temperature and chemical resistance.
  - **Polyimide (Kapton blends)**: excellent heat resistance; handle carefully to avoid cuts.

## Marking and Identifying

- Mark **both ends** of each wire and at intervals so maintenance can trace it later.
- Keep identification visible near **connectors**.

## Routing Rules of Thumb

- Avoid **sharp edges**, **hot lines**, and **moving parts**.
- Use **grommets** where bundles pass through structure and **clamps** to support runs so they do not sag or rub.
- Leave a **gentle bend radius**—no kinks. Keep a **small service loop** near connectors.

## Controlling Interference

- Separate **noisy power lines** (motors, strobes) from **sensitive avionics** runs.
- Use **shielded cable** and **proper grounding** where the installation requires it.

## Checklist

- Correct **gauge** and **insulation** for the environment.
- **Label**, **support**, and **protect** every run.
